PaLa is a blockchain protocol with the following features:
- timing model: partially synchronous ($\Delta$ is known but GST is unknown)
- fault model: Byzantine 
- tolerates fewer than $1/3$ corruptions
- responsive
- permissioned ($n$ and the set of processes is known in advance)
- based on rotating leader/proposer approach 
- corruption model: static

The protocols proceed by consecutive epochs. 
The block format: ($e$, TXs, $h_{-1}$), where $e$ is the epoch, TXs is a set of transactions, and $h_{-1}$ is the hash of the chain before this block.

There are two types of messages:
- block proposal
- vote

There are two types of blocks in the blockchain:
- normal
- timeout
